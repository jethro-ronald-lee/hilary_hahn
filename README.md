# hilary_hahn

This project explores the relationship between Spotify's liveliness and popularity ratings for ten of Hilary Hahn's tracks. This visualization is intended to emphasize that Spotify's machines still can never match humans' capacity for emotionally understanding and connecting with music. We ought to question the validity of Spotify's algorithms and encourage ourselves to seek music on our own rather than rely on Spotify's questionable curated playlists that "pertain" to our interests.
